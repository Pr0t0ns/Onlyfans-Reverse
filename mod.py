#### NOTES #### 
# - You will need to replace all the OF Operation functions any update that's pushed that contains a modified logic
# - Operations in functions should stay relavent during updates but the sign key, First Vector of Sign and final sector of sign must be updated for sign to be validated
# - https://static2.onlyfans.com/static/prod/f/202411221209-ff9b8e2d99/2313.js <-- File where sign is produced (If link isn't valid replace "202411221209-ff9b8e2d99" with the current version)
# - n.A = W =>  ||| <-- function where sign is produced
